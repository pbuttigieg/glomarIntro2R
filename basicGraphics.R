# Introduction
#
# Most of the material here has been adapted from the help files associated 
# with each function used or is circulating on the internet. It's been commented
# to help "narrate" the code. There are many good introductions to graphics
# in R which are worth reading, for example:

#=============================================================================
# R's understanding of graphics
#=============================================================================

# R has a bunch of "high-level" plotting functions that will attempt to 
# visualise data as appropriately as possible. However, R can only work with 
# the information provided to it.

# First, let's get some data that's preloaded into R
data(mtcars)

# As most things, the data is stored as an object in the working environment
# Let's find out a bit about the data

?mtcars

# To plot some data, we can call the very-high-level function plot()
# Let's say we were interested in the mpg vs the weight of the car
# To find out how R is going to "see" these variables, we can use the class()
# function

mtcars$qsec
class(mtcars$mpg)
class(mtcars$wt)

apply(
  mtcars,
  MARGIN = 2,
  class
)

# These will be interpreted as two numeric variables

plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)

# plot() detected two vectors of numeric data and defaulted to a scatter plot
# What if our variable was not numeric? The "am" variable is a factor where
# 0 = automatic and 1 = manual transmission, but does R know this?

class(mtcars$am)

# Apparently not. As it thinks "am" is numeric, plot() will probably behave
# as above...
plot(mtcars$am)

# Not a totally useless plot, but probably not the most effective for this kind
# of data. We can tell R that this is a factor rather than a numeric variable
# and then see how plot() behaves...

plot(
	as.factor(mtcars$am)
	)

# plot() now understands that it's dealing with a factor and attempts a more
# effective visualisation.


#=============================================================================
# The elements of an R graphic
#=============================================================================

# Understanding the anatomy of R graphics can help you customise and edit them
# in very flexible ways. R's graphical parameters can be queried and set by 
# the par() function.

par()

# The help file on par() is also very informative, but quite a read.

?par

# We'll get into many of these later, but, for now, we're just going to mess
# with a few to illustrate the main components of an R graphic.

# Before customising or experimenting with parameters, it's a good idea to 
# back up the default parameter list in an object, such as "op", standing for
# "original parameters".

op <- par()

# Now let's start stripping down a standard plot. We'll use a scatter plot
# we generated above as an example.
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)

# The actual plotting region, or plot, is placed in a "device" region. The
# device is the whole window or figure region you're using to plot in.
# To illustrate, resize the plot window you generated above to a rectangle.
# You'll notice the plot itself also becomes rectangular. We can force the plot
# region to be square to help us see that the plot and device area are different.

par(pty = "s")
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)

# Now, resizing the device window will not stretch out the plot region.

# Standard graphics have a background layer. Using par(), we can set the colour
# of the "bg".
par(bg = "blue")
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)

# If there's a background, there's probably a foreground...
par(fg = "white")
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)

# We see that some, but not all of the elements are included in the foreground
# There are other parameters which can be used to access and manipulate them.
# We'll see these when dealing with low-level interactions, for now, just note
# that these are different elements.

# Graphics generally have annotations like titles and axis labels. Let's use
# par to disable the "ann"otations.
par(ann = FALSE)
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)

# Generally, graphics have boxes drawn around the plot area. We can mess with
# this using the "box type" or "bty" parameter...
par(bty = "n")
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)

# By removing the box, we can now see that the axes are different entities too.
# 

# Each axis may be addressed separately by, e.g., "[x,y]axt" or 
# "[x,y] axis type"
par(xaxt = "n")
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)

par(yaxt = "n")
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)

# The margins of the plot area are also a separate entity and can be adjusted
# in a number of ways. Let's add a box to the plot to make this clearer

par(bty = "o")

par(
	mar = c(
			7, # Bottom
			7, # Left
			2, # Top
			2  # Right
			)
	)
		
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)		

# Finally, the points, bars, lines, etc that are in the plotting area can be 
# modified. In our scatterplot, we have points so let's use an appropriate 
# parameter to modify them
par(pch = "m")
par(pch = 2)
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)

# Finally, you may add multiple plots to a device
par(mfrow = c(2,2)) # A 2 x 2 plot array

# Let's fill the array with four identical plots, with all the manipulations
# we've performed on the parameters
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)
plot(as.factor(mtcars$am))
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)

# There are more subtleties to the anatomy of R graphics, but these should give
# you an idea of how to work with them. In the next section, we'll go through
# some low-level interactions which will allow you to customise your graphics.

# Before we end, let's restore the orignal parameter set
par(op)

# You'll get a few warnings here, saying that some parameters could not be set.
# This is expected, as some, likc "cin" and "cra", are read-only. You should 
# also close the device window to refresh the parameter list completely before
# creating a new plot...

par(mfrow = c(1,1))
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)

# Let's use plot() to show us the device regions. This code is a little
# involved, so feel free to run it 'blindly' if you don't wish to delve into
# it. From:
# http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/RGraphics/custombase-baseregionsnfig.R

par(oma = rep(3, 4), mfrow = c(3,2), bg = "grey80")

for (i in 1:6) {
    if (i == 3) {
		omar <- par(mar = c(2, 2, 2, 1))

#=============================================================================
# Low-level interaction with graphics
#=============================================================================

# As we've seen with par() there are many ways we can customise R graphics
# after or while they're being processed by a function like plot(). This sort 
# of activity is referred to as "low-level" interaction.

# If you haven't already done so, bring up our mpg vs wt scatterplot
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)

# Rather than running par() all the time, we can also set parameters in a call
# to plot() or many other graphing functions. In R lingo, the arguments will be
# "passed" on to par() from plot() to save some typing.

# Let's try something familiar...

plot(
	mtcars$mpg, 
	mtcars$wt,
	pch = 6
	)

# Now let's use lines and points, re-label the axes, and add a title and 
# subtitle.

plot(
	mtcars$mpg, 
	mtcars$wt,
	pch = 6,
	main = "Weight vs fuel consumption",
	sub = "Heavy car, light wallet",
	xlab = "Miles per gallon",
	ylab = "Weight in thousands of lbs",
	col = "red"
	)

# Many low-level manipulations can be done directly in a plotting function.
# However, when things start getting complicated, it's sometimes better to
# gradually build your plot. This gives you more control over the end result
# and prevents the code for one function becoming too complicated.

# Let's explore this alernative. First, we'd want to create a relatively
# empty plot in our device...

plot(
	mtcars$mpg, 
	mtcars$wt,
	type = "n",		# we supress plotting of symbols 
	ann = FALSE,	# and prevent any annotation of labels or titles
	bty = "n",		# no box
	axes = FALSE	# no axes, individual axes can be disabled, see below:
	#xaxt = "n",		# no x-axis
	#yaxt = "n",		# no y-axis
	)

# That's certainly relatively empty. Now we can add the elements interactively,
# in a low-level approach. Keep in mind, you don't need to write code defining
# the various parameters if you're already happy with the defaults. If you know
# you like a certain kind of plot element, make it a default using the par()
# function as described above. you can save your preferences as an object.

# Titles for the plot, the axes, and other elements can be added with title()

# Legends can be plotted using legend() or smartlegend() from the gplots package
# Let's leave our scatter plot to illustrate how to create a legend. This example
# is from the ?legend material and will put a bunch of skills you've seen to use

# First we define some legend text
leg.txt <- c("Setosa Petals", "Setosa Sepals", "Versicolor Petals", "Versicolor Sepals")

# We're going to plot 5 legends at the same x coordinate, but different
# y coordinates, so we'll define a vector of y coords
y.leg <- c(4.5, 3, 2.1, 1.4, .7)

# We also want different character expansion factors to be used for each legend
cexv  <- c(1.2, 1, 4/5, 2/3, 1/2)

# We use matplot() or "matrix plot" to lay down a basic plot space

 	type = "n",
 	xlab = "Length",
 	ylab = "Width",
	main = "Petal and Sepal Dimensions in Iris Blossoms"
	)

# We'll use a for loop to automate the plotting. If this is too complicated for
# now, see the legend() command below the for loop for a simper example. The
# for loop is contained within braces "{}"
for (i in seq(cexv)){
	# First, we'll paste some text on the graph to describe the cex of the
	# legends
	text(
		1, # X coordinate
		y.leg[i] - 0.1, # Y coords in our y.leg vector minus a small correction
 		paste(			# paste in labels
			"cex=",
 			cexv[i]		# loop through and paste in different cex values
			),
 		cex = 0.8,		# set a constant cex for our labels
 		adj = 0			# text right at coords defined
		)
	
	# Now we use legend() to plot a bunch of legends

							# be printed on a new line

							# we used real characters rather than numeric codes
							# notice that each character will be used 
							# sequentially
 		col = c(1, 3),		# Two colours will be used. As there are four lines
							# this vector will be recycled. In this context, 
							# this makes sense.

							# legend

# plot one column of a matrix against another...

													# otherwise expression()
													# will ignore anything
													# after the comma
    col.main = "blue" # A blue title would be nice
